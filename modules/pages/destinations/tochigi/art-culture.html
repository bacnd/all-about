                    <p class="b-text">Japan is a nation with a long-held and highly regarded ceramic history. And the town of Mashiko, in Tochigi Prefecture, is home to one of the most beautiful and unique forms of pottery in Japan. Mashiko ware, also known as Mashiko-yaki, is a rich and earthy form of pottery used for everyday items like jars, plates, cups, and mortar bowls. But its unique form of glaze and the artistic ideologies of its early creators are indicators that Mashiko ware didn't sacrifice form for function.</p>

                    <p class="b-text">Mashiko ware was first created during the Edo Period (1603-1868) when ceramicist Keizaburo Otsuka moved to Mashiko in 1853 to set up his pottery business. Otsuka, after studying in Ibaraki Prefecture, produced pieces using a pure form of clay, one rich in silicic acid and iron, pliable, and highly fire-resistant. Mashiko ware, unlike many other forms of pottery, doesn't add additional ingredients to the clay, which is why it feels so thick, rustic, and almost warm to touch. </p>

                    Mashiko ware, glazed with a combination of stone and scrap iron powder, is an ideal canvas for artisans to display their creativity. During the Showa Period (1926-1989), Mashiko local Shoji Hamada crafted pieces of ceramic covered in uniquely beautiful designs, showcasing a style of artistic expression rarely seen and inspiring ceramicists and artists across the country. His home is now a memorial to his legacy, and is open to the public. In 1979, Mashiko ware became recognized as a National Traditional Craft and remains today as a form of Japanese art with one foot in the past, and one firmly planted in the future. To learn more about this enduring art form, visitors should also stop by the Mashiko Museum of Ceramic Art, which features a vast display of different ceramics.

                        <p>While Japan has many noteworthy pottery traditions, the functional beauty of Mashiko ware is undeniably alluring. A little over an hour from Tokyo by train, Mashiko is well worth a visit. The tradition has made its mark on the region, and a stroll through town is like wandering through an open-air studio. If a piece catches your eye, you can take a small part of Japan home with you.</p>
