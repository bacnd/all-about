                    <p class="b-text">While debates over the history of sushi can get as fiery as a large mouthful of wasabi, many agree that the present-day style can be credited to one man, Yohei Hanaya, who developed Edomae sushi. Hanaya is thought to be the first to press neta (toppings) onto vinegared rice by hand to create bite-sized morsels. “Edomae” means “in the Edo style,” as Edo is the former name for Tokyo.</p>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p class="b-text">Hanaya would also simmer the neta in a light broth or marinate them with vinegar and salt to help with preservation. Through Hanaya’s innovativeness, Edomae sushi came to have two meanings: sushi made with ingredients from Tokyo Bay (the waters around Edo were considered Edomae) or neta that aren’t simply served plain and uncooked. He didn’t, however, have his big break until he set up a yatai, or street stall, where he could sell his tasty snacks quickly and easily to the busy people of Edo.</p>

                    From convenience stores to conveyor belt joints, the variety of sushi nationwide is as astounding as it is tantalizing. However, it has also evolved into an art form that embodies seasonality, respect for each ingredient, and kodawari, the pursuit of perfection. Travelers to Tokyo shouldn’t miss out on a high-end sushi course served by a highly trained itamae, or master sushi chef.
